# üèÜ Sports Betting Platform

## Project Vision

To create a transparent, decentralized, and fair sports betting ecosystem that eliminates intermediaries, ensures instant payouts, and provides equal opportunities for all participants through blockchain technology. Our vision is to revolutionize the sports betting industry by leveraging smart contracts to create a trustless environment where outcomes are immutable and winnings are automatically distributed.

## Project Description

The Sports Betting Platform is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to place bets on various sports events and competitions. The platform operates through smart contracts, ensuring transparency, security, and automatic execution of betting logic.

The system allows platform administrators to create betting events with specific teams or outcomes, while users can place bets using cryptocurrency. Once events conclude, administrators resolve the outcomes, and winners can automatically claim their proportional share of the total betting pool, minus a small platform fee.

The platform uses a pool-based betting system where all bets for an event are collected into a common pool, and winners share the entire pool proportionally based on their bet amounts. This creates dynamic odds that adjust based on betting volume and provides potentially higher returns compared to traditional fixed-odds betting.
